        <h1>We Provide</h1>
        <p>Feed Africa Foundation is a 501 (C)(3) charitable organization who will build homeless children shelters in
            each
            of the
            countries we work in. This shelter will house youth for up to 6 weeks, during which time we will assist them
            in
            being
            adopted, fostered, or placed in a job, depending on their age. For children (under 15), they may remain in
            the
            shelter
            for up to 3 months. The shelter will also serve as a food pantry for those residing in it and for those in
            nearby
            communities. We will also rent an office space which will double as a community center/food pantry.</p>
